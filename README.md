# My Island

An island scene rendered using the [Three.js 3D graphics library](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/). The tree objects were created using [Blender 2.79b](https://www.blender.org/). A Three.js [add-on](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/f64bb2de94640062c1869fb796a2802adfc74477/utils/exporters/blender/addons/io_three) was used to export the Blender objects into the json format. The images used to create the tree textures were obtained from [pngimg.com](http://pngimg.com/download/2499) and [textures.com](https://www.textures.com/download/barkpalm0052/28006?q=palm+tree).
